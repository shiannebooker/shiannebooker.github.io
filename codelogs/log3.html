    <h1>How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?</h1>
    <p>According to an Article from CSS-Tricks.com, A CSS Media Querie is one way developers basically tell the browser how to show the media in the viewport. It can be used to apply styles or run other code based on the style. It is useful because not only does it target the viewport width, but it also can be used to target things like screen resolution, device orientation, operating system preferences, and more. One downfall of CSS Media Queries is that if they are overused, they can make your code too complex to maintain. In this specific article, it mentions there being 150 browsers, 50 combinations of user preferences, and more than 24k different Android devices alone. All of these numbers add up to a whopping 18 million possible ways for content to be displayed.This is why it is important to make sure your media is being displayed correctly, especially before a user sees it and thinks, “What the heck?”</p>
    <h1>What "media features" are supported by media queries — such as "orientation" or "max-width" — and what do they do?</h1>
