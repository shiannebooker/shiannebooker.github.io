  <h1>CSS Measuring Units</h1>
  <h2>What is the difference between absolute and relative CSS units?</h2>
  <p>The biggest thing that separates absolute and relative CSS units is how they develop and render in their final stage. For example, an absolute unit is a fixed unit, meaning that the size of the screen it's displayed on does not matter, the value of it will remain the same. For relative CSS units, it's a little bit different. The word relative is actually a clue to what it means. The value is "relative" to another value. So, when one value changes, all of the other values that are related will change as well. It's kind of like a domino effect. An example unit below '%' will go into a little more detil about what that may look like.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Units:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>px, pt: Px stands for pixels. This is one of the more common units, and its mostly used for web pages. It's an absolute length that determines the size of a single dot in the display. Pt means points, and it is most commonly used for documents with the intention of being printed. A pt is the absolute length that is equal to 1/72nd of an inch. </li>
    <li>in, pc: In stands for inches, and represents the absolute length that is equivilent to inches. On the other hand, pc stands for pica, and it is a measurement that is mainly used in typography and print design. 1 pica is equal to 12 points. So it's just a tad bigger than points.</li>
    <li>%: Next is the % unit. It is a relative unit, meaning that its size will depend on the size of other values. For example, the % is relative to the parent element. So, if the parent element is changed, so will the %.</li>
  </ul>
