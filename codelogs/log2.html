  <h1>CSS Measuring Units</h1>
  <h2>What is the difference between absolute and relative CSS units?</h2>
  <p>The biggest thing that separates absolute and relative CSS units is how they develop and render in their final stage. For example, an absolute unit is a fixed unit, meaning that the size of the screen it's displayed on does not matter, the value of it will remain the same. For relative CSS units, it's a little bit different. The word relative is actually a clue to what it means. The value is "relative" to another value. So, when one value changes, all of the other values that are related will change as well. It's kind of like a family tree. An example unit below '%' will go into a little more detil about what that tree may look like.</p>
  <h2>Examples of Units:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>px, pt:</li>
    <li>in, pc:</li>
    <li>%:</li>
  </ul>
