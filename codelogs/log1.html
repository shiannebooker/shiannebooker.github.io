    <h2>What is the difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML?</h2>
      <p>In HTML, the two types of tags are non-semantic and semantic. A semantic tag has context in the name of the tag that you are using, about what the tag does. While a non-semantic tag only tells the browser how it should display the content on your website. For example, the common &lt;div&gt; tag is a divider tag that simply groups things together. Another semantic code is the &lt;span&gt; tag, which acts like a spacer for the formatting. As a beginner coder, I use non-semantic tags the most. In this website specifically, I have used &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, and &lt;p&gt; tags, which are all used to tell the browser where to put things, and essentially format my writing. I like using these the most because they are simple and give a clean look to the website. The biggest difference I see between the two is that non-semantic tags are less vague than the semantic ones. I will be honest when I say I had to look up what a &lt;span&gt; tag meant, because I don't use it as often!</p>
    <h2>What are two or more benefits of using semantic tags?</h2>
      <p>

        According to my research, here are a few benefits of using semantic tags:
        <ul>

            <li>Better chance of popping up in a search - Search engines use semantic tags when pulling up websites, and it helps the engine understand the context of the website a lot more than only having non-semantic tags. (wow, the more you know!)</li>
            <li>Better accessibility - Technologies that offer screen reading for users who may not see as well often make it easier for the website to be read back to the user. Pretty cool to think about as someone who wears glasses pretty regularly.</li>
            <li>Easier on developers - Apparently, for seasoned developers, semantic tags are easier on the eyes, and they can quickly understand the code (not me #non-semantictagsforlife) (jk)</li>

        </ul>
        These are just a few, and they actually seem to be really helpful, especially for the browser. I think it’s nice that it also adds a little bit of accessibility, even if it's not really meant to!
