    <h2>What is the difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML?</h2>
      <p>In HTML, the two types of tags are non-semantic and semantic. A semantic tag has context in the name of the tag that you are using, about what the tag does. While a non-semantic tag only tells the browser how it should display the content on your website. For example, the common &lt;div&gt; tag is a divider tag that simply groups things together. Another semantic code is the &lt;span&gt; tag, which acts like a spacer for the formatting. As a beginner coder, I use non-semantic tags the most. In this website specifically, I have used &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, and &lt;p&gt; tags, which are all used to tell the browser where to put things, and essentially format my writing. I like using these the most because they are simple and give a clean look to the website. The biggest difference I see between the two is that non-semantic tags are less vague than the semantic ones. I will be honest when I say I had to look up what a &lt;span&gt; tag meant, because I don't use it as often!</p>
